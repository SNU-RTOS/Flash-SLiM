128,"Tranquil village nestled in green valley, clear river meandering through wildflower meadows. Ancient stone bridge, weathered by time, stands as sentinel, arches reflecting in calm water below. Generations have passed, lovers whispers heard, childrens songs sung, travelers footsteps echoed. River gurgles beneath, water cool and clear, revealing mossy stones on riverbed. Dragonflies dance in sunlit air, iridescent wings like jewels flashing. Sweet scent of honeysuckle, gentle buzz of bees collecting nectar from clover fields."
